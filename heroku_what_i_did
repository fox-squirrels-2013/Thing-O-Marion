Steps used to push my project to heroku:

rm -rf /users/apprentice/.ssh/id_rsa*
heroku login
heroku keys, remove other keys
heroku keys:remove
heroku keys:add

gemfile must have the ruby line
Gemfile.lock must be current

git stores heroku information so may need to delete entire
application and re-fetch it from the github

heroku create
git remote -v
heroku sharing
git push heroku master
heroku logs

... next how to have multiple users' ssh keys on same computer
... should be able to just login and then add the keys and then
create and push the heroku record

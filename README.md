This is a run little app that let's users enter their favorite songs. It's going to run using Sinatra which is a web framework thing-y written in Ruby. I think what Sinatra does is give us meethods to run GET and PUT requests to interact with a server, and interpret embedded Ruby within the routes. And maybe also other kinds of embedded content. But I'm not sure about that last part.
